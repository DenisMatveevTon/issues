**About the task**

The goal of the contest is to use manual testing to find critical bugs in products in the TON ecosystem.

By critical bugs we mean UX inconsistencies, logical contradictions, and functional shortcomings. The bugs are considered to disturb the user experience and interfere with standard app actions — e.g., Toncoin transaction, NFT displaying, app freezing, etc.

While evaluating, the projects’ teams may not take into account the reports like ‘that could be done better’ and some small GUI disadvantages — such reports will be simply ignored. Please, focus on critical bugs.

**How to submit**

First, go through the @toncontest_bot to share with us your GitHub account and TON wallet address so we may reward you in case you win.

Then choose any product reflected on the ton.org website and test it.

All bug reports will be collected in the project repositories. The repositories are also provided in the list of projects.

To make a bug report, go to the repository of the TON ecosystem project, follow the template of the issue, and provide a detailed explanation of the bug. Support the issue with a screencast or screenshots, if needed.

Please, follow the template for the issue in each repository. It will also be taken into account during the approval of the pull request.

Before creating a report, make sure that there is no similar issue through the repository. If your report is recognized as a duplicate of one of them, the issue will be not reviewed.

**Evaluation and prizes**

Winners of the contest will get prizes in Toncoin, the cryptocurrency native to the TON blockchain.

Each TON ecosystem project team will examine and double-check all the issues in its repository. Then each team will choose the top five bug reports. Each author of these bugs will get up to 500 TON, based on the teams’ evaluation.

There is also a 15,000 TON prize pool for the rest of the bug reports. This prize fund will be distributed depending on the joint decision of each TON ecosystem project and the TON Foundation.

The top participants will get a chance to join the core TON Foundation team as manual QA Engineers.
